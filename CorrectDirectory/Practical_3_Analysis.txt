PRACTICAL 3 â€“ PROLOG SEARCH TREE ANALYSIS
=========================================

MY PROLOG QUERY
---------------

Query I used:
    trace, actor(M, A, _), director(M, D), director(_, A), A \= D.

What I was trying to find:
    I wanted to find actors who have also directed movies, but specifically 
    looking at cases where they acted in a movie that was directed by 
    someone else (not themselves).

Why I chose this query:
    - It has multiple conditions that create depth in the search tree
    - It shows interesting relationships in the movie database
    - It demonstrates backtracking well when actors are also directors
    - It's complex enough to generate a tree with 3+ levels

How the query works step by step:
    1. First, find an actor A in some movie M
    2. Then find who directed that same movie M (call them D)
    3. Check that actor A has also directed some movie (any movie)
    4. Make sure that A and D are different people

So basically, I'm looking for actor-directors who worked under other directors.

MY TRACE FILE
-------------

How I made the trace.txt file:
    1. Went to SWISH Prolog and loaded Movies_Short.pl
    2. Typed my query exactly as shown above
    3. Clicked "Step into" over and over until I got through the whole search
    4. Copied all the text from the Prolog window into a file called trace.txt

What to expect in the trace:
    You'll see lots of "Call:" and "Exit:" lines as Prolog tries different 
    combinations. There are also "Fail:" when things don't work and "Redo:" 
    when Prolog backtracks to try different options.

READING MY TREE VISUALIZATION
------------------------------

Files my code creates:
    - backtracking_search.png (the main tree picture)
    - backtracking_search.txt (text version if the picture is hard to read)

How to understand the tree:

COLOR CODING EXPLANATION:
    - PURPLE nodes: Prolog starting a new search ("Call:")
    - LIGHT GREEN nodes: Intermediate successes ("Exit:" for actor/director finds)
    - BLUE nodes: Final successful matches (actor-director pairs that satisfy all conditions)
    - RED nodes: Dead ends where things failed ("Fail:")
    - ORANGE nodes: Backtracking to try alternatives ("Redo:")
    - BRIGHT GREEN nodes with stars: Highlighted successful paths

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT "MATCHES":
    In the tree visualization, you'll see two types of successful nodes:
    
    1. LIGHT GREEN nodes ("Exit: Found actor/director"): 
       These are INTERMEDIATE successes - Prolog found an actor or director, 
       but this doesn't mean the overall query succeeded yet.
    
    2. BLUE nodes ("Exit: Director X for movie Y"): 
       These are PARTIAL successes - a director was found for a movie, but 
       we still need to check if the actor has also directed movies.
    
    3. BRIGHT GREEN nodes with ðŸŽ‰ symbols: 
       These are the TRUE FINAL MATCHES - where all conditions are satisfied:
       - Actor found in a movie
       - Director found for that movie  
       - Actor has directed some other movie
       - Actor and director are different people

What the tree shows:
    The tree follows Prolog's exact search process. It starts at the top 
    (root) and branches out as Prolog tries different possibilities. When 
    you see it going down and then suddenly jumping back up, that's 
    backtracking happening.

Why my tree has good depth:
    Because my query has multiple conditions that depend on each other, 
    Prolog has to search through several layers:
    Level 1: Start the search
    Level 2: Look for actors
    Level 3: For each actor, look for their movies
    Level 4: For each movie, look for the director
    Level 5: Check if the actor is also a director elsewhere
    Level 6: Verify the actor and director are different people

This creates a nice deep tree that shows how Prolog really works.

HOW TO RUN MY CODE
------------------

What you need:
    - Python 3 (I used 3.8 but any recent version should work)
    - Two libraries: treelib and graphviz

To install the libraries, run:
    pip install treelib graphviz

Steps to run:
    1. Put my Python file and your trace.txt in the same folder
    2. Open command prompt/terminal in that folder
    3. Type: python Akaza.py
    4. Wait for it to finish - it will tell you what files it created

If you have problems:
    - Make sure trace.txt is exactly named that way
    - If you get graphviz errors, you might need to install Graphviz 
      separately from their website
    - The text file version (backtracking_search.txt) always works 
      even if the picture doesn't generate


This practical really helped me understand how Prolog's search works 
behind the scenes. The visualization makes it much easier to see what's 
happening compared to just reading the trace text.
